##SE Block
####A Google Chrome Extension

This is a Google Chrome extension that cleans up some of the cruft from the otherwise excellent Stack Exchange pages. 

The idea for the extension came about as I started my first job as a web developer and, subsequently, came to spend more and more of my day scanning Stack Overflow, Server Fault, Ask Ubuntu, &amp;c. I became increasingly distracted by the sidebar links, which may have had to do with all of the coffee I drink. 

Rather than just popping open the browser console to individually hide the modules on especially jittery days, I decided to just write an extension to block them all of the time.

*Please note that this code collects no information. It simply searches for specifically-named divs and hides them.*
